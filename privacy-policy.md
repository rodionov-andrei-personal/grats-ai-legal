# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** May 6, 2025

Grats AI ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile app, Grats AI.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect the following information to operate and improve the app:

* **Anonymous Identifier:** We assign a unique identifier (UUID) to each user. This is used internally to track app usage and manage in-app purchases (tokens).
* **In-App Purchases:** If you buy tokens, your purchase is processed by Apple. We store the number of tokens associated with your UUID.
* **User Images:** If you choose to use photos from your iPhone gallery, we access those images with your permission using Apple's native photo picker. These images remain on your device and are never uploaded, transmitted, or stored on our servers or third-party servers.
* **Usage Analytics:** We use Amplitude to collect anonymized usage data (e.g., screen views, button taps, feature usage). This helps us improve the app's functionality and user experience. No personal images or private text are shared with Amplitude.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

* Generate personalized congratulatory cards using AI (text and images).
* Manage your token balance and in-app purchases.
* Improve and maintain the performance, design, and features of the app.
* Analyze anonymous usage trends via Amplitude to enhance user experience.

## 3. AI Services and Third-Party Providers

Grats AI uses third-party AI services (e.g., ChatGPT by OpenAI) to generate text and images based on your input. When you request content generation, your prompt may be sent to these services.

We do not send any of your private photos to AI services.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

* We store UUIDs and token balances securely on our servers.
* We use industry-standard security practices to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.

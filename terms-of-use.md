# Terms of Use

**Effective Date:** May 6, 2025

Welcome to Grats AI ("App", "we", "our", or "us"). These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Grats AI mobile application. By using the app, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.

## 1. Use of the App

Grats AI allows users to generate congratulatory cards using AI-generated text and images, and optionally include their own photos. The app is intended for personal, non-commercial use only.

## 2. User Content

- You may choose to use your own photos via Apple's photo picker.
- All content you create using the app (including images, messages, and designs) is your responsibility.
- You must not use the app to create or send harmful, offensive, or illegal content.

## 3. AI-Generated Content

The app uses third-party AI services (e.g., ChatGPT by OpenAI) to generate images and text based on user input. You acknowledge and agree that:

- AI-generated results may be unpredictable or contain inaccuracies.
- You will not use generated content in a way that violates any laws or the rights of others.
- We do not claim ownership of AI-generated content you create, but we reserve the right to restrict use if it violates these Terms.

## 4. Purchases and Tokens

- Grats AI uses tokens, which you can purchase via Apple's in-app purchase system.
- Tokens are non-refundable and have no monetary value outside the app.
- Purchased tokens are tied to your device and cannot be transferred or shared across multiple devices, even if they use the same Apple ID.

## 5. Privacy

- Your use of the app is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect and use your data.
- We do not upload your personal images or store them on our servers.
- We use Amplitude to gather analytics about how the app is used, helping us improve functionality and user experience. This data is collected in a privacy-conscious way and does not include your personal images.

## 6. User Restrictions

You agree not to:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or modify any part of the app.
- Use the app for commercial purposes without written permission.
- Attempt to disrupt or compromise app security or infrastructure.

## 7. Termination

We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the app at any time and without notice if you violate these Terms.

## 8. Disclaimers

- The app is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind.
- We do not guarantee that AI-generated content will be accurate, appropriate, or error-free.
- We are not liable for any damages resulting from your use of the app.

## 9. Changes to Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes are posted means you accept the revised Terms.
